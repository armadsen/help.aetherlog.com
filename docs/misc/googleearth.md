## Overview

Aether can export KML (Keyhole Markup Language) files for import into mapping software like Google Earth. This will allow you to see a map of all the QSOs in your log at once in Google Earth. This page includes instructions for exporting a KML file from Aether and importing it into Google Earth.

As Google Earth is third-party software, I am unable to provide any technical support for it.
