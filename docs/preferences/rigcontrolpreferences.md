## Overview

![Rig Control Preferences Tab](/images/RigControlPreferences.png)

The Rig Control tab of preferences allows you to configure and enable rig control in Aether. The settings here are mostly self explanatory and more information about rig control can be found in the [Rig Control Guide](/rigcontrol/rigcontrol.md).

#### microHAM Interface

Enable this option only if you're using a microHAM USB II or USB III interface. Enabling this option fixes a problem where the interface continuously keys down the rig's transmit line anytime rig control is enabled. Note that this option does not have anything to do with microHAM's microKeyer (and other) interfaces, which Aether [does not support](/rigcontrol/riginterfaces/#note-about-fancy-interfaces).
